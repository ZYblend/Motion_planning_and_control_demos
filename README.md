# Motion_planning_and_control_demos

In this Repo, we practice the classical motion planning and control algorithm mainly in C++, (partially in Python).

This repo is for experienced engineers or researchers who already understood 
- **Search-based Planning** (BFS, DFS)
- **Sampling-based Planning**
- **Optimization-based Planning**

But have been interested in the implementation of them in C++.

Different **data structures** will be investigated 

Different **algorithms** setup will be investigated

regarding to **time complexity** and **space complexity**.
